# Warrior Quest: The Curse of Eldoria

You are Kaelen, a young warrior from the village of Dunhaven, a peaceful settlement on the edge of the Cursed Lands. For generations, your people have lived in fear of Lord Malagar, a dark sorcerer who dwells in the ruins of Eldoria, the once-great kingdom now shrouded in darkness.

One fateful night, Malagar’s forces—twisted beasts and shadowy warriors—descend upon Dunhaven, stealing the sacred Soulstone, a relic said to protect your village from evil. Without it, your home will fall into ruin within days.

With a sword in hand and courage in your heart, you embark on a quest to retrieve the Soulstone and end Malagar’s reign. Along the way, you must:

 - Navigate The Whispering Woods, where lost souls whisper secrets… and lies.
 - Cross The Hollow Marsh, home to the fearsome Bogwyrm.
 - Enter the Ruins of Eldoria, where the undead guard Malagar’s dark tower.

But be warned—Malagar is no ordinary foe. He has foreseen your coming, and the deeper you go, the more dangerous your journey becomes. Will you defeat the sorcerer and restore peace, or will you fall like the warriors before you?

Your choices will decide your fate in Warrior Quest.
